# @agentionai/marshall-tools

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Add an `ask_user` tool so an agent can ask a genuine question mid-task.

  The tool surfaces a question to the user — with optional numbered options,
  multi-select and a free-text "Other" — and returns their answer to the model.
  It is wired up end-to-end: `packages/tools` provides `createAskTool`, the engine
  exposes it on the belt whenever the client implements `askUser` (beyond approval,
  which only happens over a state-changing action), and the CLI renders it with a
  dedicated `QuestionPanel` that queues parallel questions and chains through them
  one at a time.

  Prompt guidance was added so the model treats it as a tool for genuine ambiguity
  that blocks progress, not a confirmation dialog — the same rule the accompanying
  system prompt carries.

  Usage: `npm run cli`, then ask the agent something open-ended it cannot infer
  (which target, which stack, which direction) and it can stop and ask.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 6f94195: Fix the `search` tool's file matching, single-file targets, and invalid regexes.

  `fileGlob` matched anywhere in the full path, so a glob meant to filter by extension also
  matched directory names containing the same text; it now matches the basename only. `search`
  also rejected a direct file path (it only ever walked directories), threw uncaught on an invalid
  regex instead of returning an error, and had an off-by-one in its truncation flag. Per-file reads
  during a search are now capped so one huge file can't blow the budget.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- c6a82b9: Connect remote MCP servers over HTTP and use their tools.

  `adaptMcpTools` wraps the tools Agention's `MCPClient` discovers so they obey the
  same contract as the builtin belt: namespaced (`mcp__<server>__<tool>`) so a
  server cannot shadow `read_file`, never throwing, always returning a string,
  bounded by a timeout and the task's abort signal, and gated by approval —
  provenance is unknowable, so consent is mandatory. `McpRegistry` in the engine
  owns connection lifecycle; an unreachable server degrades to a reported error
  rather than a broken session.

  The CLI gains `/mcp`, `/mcp add` (a wizard for url, name, token and scope) and
  `/mcp remove|reconnect <name>`. Server definitions and their credentials live in
  the global config at `0600`; a project's `.marshall/config.json` may only select
  from them via `mcp.enable`/`mcp.disable`, and credentials on a project-declared
  server are stripped on read, since that file is meant to be committed.

  Also lays the groundwork for automated approval: `ApprovalRequest` now carries
  structured `input` and a `source` describing where the tool came from, and the
  session resolves approvals through an ordered chain of `ApprovalDecider`s that
  can each defer. An agent that judges requests and escalates only the risky ones
  becomes one entry in that chain, with no tool changing.

- dfdeb9a: Background shell commands that outlive the turn that started them.

  `run_shell` takes a `background` option: it returns a job id immediately instead of blocking, and the agent carries on. New `shell_output`, `shell_kill` and `shell_list` tools read and manage running jobs, backed by a session-scoped `createBackgroundJobs` registry that must be injected as `ToolConfig.jobs` (and killed via `killAll()` on teardown).

  When a job finishes, its result is fed back into the conversation and — unless `autoResume: false` — the engine starts a turn to act on it, capped by `autoResumeBudget` (default 4) consecutive unattended turns. The CLI gains `/jobs` and `/jobs kill <id>`.
